## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 Part 1
I really enjoyed this lab because it was the first time learning and creating strings and using cin and cout. It was a really helpful lab because for the next couple of labs after that, I would sometimes go back and refer to it. After this lab I really got the understanding of how to properly use cin and cout. 

Lab 6, Part 2
Lab 6, part 2 is probably my second favorite lab we have done. I’ve only played blackjack a couple of times just for fun and this lab was really cool to code. It was most fun to write the if statements on if I were to have a 2 all the way to a card with a number 10.

Lab 12, Part 1
This lab is by far my favorite lab because creating my own animation was really cool to me. And in part 1 even though I didn’t technically create one, the code for it was interesting. This was also the only lab I did by myself because I was sick on the day of the lab. So this was a real challenge for me, but that is one of the reasons this is my most favorite lab and part 1 was great.
